Tasks:

 -Not game related:
	-Game web design (including video and picture).
	-README file with all needed info.
	-To make sure that the last build (.zip) is properly uploaded. Test in CITM computers.

 -Game related:

	-Art related:
		1. Find and take note of every visual element of the level. This includes: scenario elements (including destroying sprites),
		   enemies (all sprites including deaths), NPCs(being hit sprites too), power ups, particles (enemies shots),
		   UI and backgrounds. Create a list called sprite_list. (estimated time: 2 days)
		2. Exctract all sprites in sprite_list from MAME. (estimated time: 2 days)
		3. Group all sprites in pngs (particles spritesheet, enemies spritesheet...) working with the code section.
		   (estimated time: 5 days)
		4. Resize sprites if needed and possible art problem fixes. (estimated time: 2 days)
		
		IMPORTANT!: use the proper tile program as the teachers told us to not have to find coordenates manually.

		Total estimated time: 11 days. 
		Start date: ASAP.
		Due to: 21-22th May.

	-Audio related:
		1. Find all FX and music needed and label it. (estimated time: 4 days)
		2. Organize all sound files and convert to .ogg if necessary. (estimated time: 1 day)
		3. Check that every sound is like the original game and possible sound problem fixes. (estimated time: 2 days)
		
		Total estimated time: 7 days.
		Start date: 21-22th May.
		Due to: 27-28th May.

	-QA related:

		1. Check every piece of new code as it's been implemented to find bugs early. (constant progress)
		2. Check if animations, enemy spawn times, difficulty, etc. is like the original game. (estimated time: 2 days)
		3. Bug tracking and recording for the alpha (estimated time: 7 days)

		Total estimated time: 9 days.
		Start date: 21-22th May.
		Due to: 30th May.

	-Code related:
		
		1. Debug current version so it has no bugs and we can start coding with a "clean" base. (estimated time: 3 days)
		2. Code debug functionalities: god mode, instant win/lose. (estimated time: 1 day)
		3. Clean, optimize, make readable and organize all code. (estimated time: 2 days)
		4. Implement features not done yet, including: dynamite throw, working UI, state machines, etc. (estimated time: 10 days)

		Total estimated time: 26 days       
		Start date: ASAP.
		Due to: 26-28th May.		

	-Management related:

		1. Work as administrator to join all individual work. (constant progress)
		2. Take care of outside relations (teacher, other groups). (constant progress)
