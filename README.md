# UPC DDV Project 1: BloodBros
We are a group of studients from UPC studying a Design and Development of Videogames degree and this is a repository where we will be making a tribute to Blood Bros, an arcade game originaly made by TAD Corporation. The main characters are a cowboy and a Native American, which are two brothers with the goal to capture the most dangerous bandit of the West, Big Bad John.

## Usage
Aim and player are engaged, they can not move independently, so when moving the player the aim will move too and at higher speed. 
  - 'A' to move left. 
  - 'B' to move right. 
  - 'S' to crouch (while crouching you can't move).
  - 'K' to jump, this will help you to dodge the enemy bullets.
  - 'J' to shoot. 
  - 'SPACE' to start.
