## Developing rules.


1. Let's keep respectful and open with everyone's ideas and work. 

2. Let's try to be open to critics and understand that your own ideas maybe are not as good as you thought.

3. Any WORKING piece of the game (no matter if code, art or other) done by another partner should not be deleted without 
it's aknowledge. If he can't be warned, always keep a backup of his work.

4. Lack of time, knowledge, proper computer or software is understandable. Lazyness is not. 
If someone is the "lazy ass" it will be shown to the teacher and he will face the consequences.

5. It's better to work with friends than with just partners, so let's try to be cool with each other.

6. Organization is key, and it's everyone's matter, not only of the manager role.

7. We must be cohesive in all work, specially on code and documentation.

8. No cheating, please (copying code, blaming problems on third parties, etc.) It's better undone that badly done.

9. Communication. Mind the team when taking decisions. Most of problems can be resolved by civiliced discussions.

10. Enjoy the project and have fun.
